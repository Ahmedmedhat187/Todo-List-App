# Todo-List-App

This is **Todo list app** for add and remove notes to database, using Room database and LiveData and ViewModel

I use in this project:


1 - Using **Room** Libraray to deal with database for better performance, less boilerplate code, SQL validation at compile time.

2 - Using **Dao** interface for accessing data from Room database.

3 - Using **Live Data** to observe changes in database when it happens.

4 - Using **View Model** to catch data and return it to views when configuration changes(rotate device).

5 - Using **Life Cycle** to allow non-lifecycle object to be lifecycle aware.

6 - Using **Executors** to run background tasks.

7 - Using **View Model Factory** to create ViewModel with multiple arguments.

8 - Using **Intent** for moving and passing data between activities.

9 - Using **RecyclerView** and RecyclerView **ViewHolder** for viewing data for better performance.

10 - Using **Card View** to view each Note in a card.

11 - Using **TextView** for note description and **Radio Button** for priority and **Fab** to add new note.

12 - Using **ItemTouchHelper** for delete note on **on Swipe**
